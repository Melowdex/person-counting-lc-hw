### Code Structure and Usage

The code is organized into Jupyter notebooks for easy readability and explanation.

#### Notebooks Overview:

* **`train.py`** and **`results.ipynb`**:

  * Contain training and validation of different modified FOMO versions (each trained five times).
  * Quantization is also performed in `results.ipynb`.
  * the dens method isn't used due to a fault in the implementation
