### Code Structure and Usage

The code is organized into Jupyter notebooks for easy readability and explanation.

#### Notebooks Overview:

* **`train_model.ipynb`** and **`results.ipynb`**:

  * Contain training and validation of different FOMO versions (each trained five times).
  * Quantization is also performed in `results.ipynb`.

* **`train_model_loaf.ipynb`** and **`test_model_loaf.ipynb`**:

  * Used for training and evaluating FOMO on the LOAF dataset.

  * The LOAF dataset can be downloaded from the official [LOAF website](https://loafisheye.github.io/download.html).

  * More information for download and file structure is in the readme of the dataset directory
