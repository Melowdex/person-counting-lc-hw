### Code Structure and Usage

The code is organized into Jupyter notebooks for easy readability and explanation.

#### Notebooks Overview:

* **`train_model.ipynb`** and **`test_model.ipynb`**:

  * Contain training and validation of different modified FOMO versions (each trained five times).
  * Quantization is also performed in `test_model.ipynb`.
